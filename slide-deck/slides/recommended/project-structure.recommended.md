##  Project Structure

How should I organize my code?

note:
- How do we best utilize this plugin?
- Always a trouble, analysis paralysis
- In this talk, we'll go over one way to do it
    - gradle multi-project build, which both the react & ng2 profile utilize
    - note that it would work perfectly well to have just one project, we'd just recommend separating
