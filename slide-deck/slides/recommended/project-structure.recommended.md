##  Project Structure

How should I organize my code?

note:
- How do we best utilize this plugin?
- Always a trouble, analysis paralysis
- In this talk, we'll go over two ways to do it
    - gradle multi-project build, which both the react 2.x & ng2 profile utilize
    - better for deploying & working on separately 
    - a single project build, which the react 1.x profile utilizes
    - more traditional grails deploy
