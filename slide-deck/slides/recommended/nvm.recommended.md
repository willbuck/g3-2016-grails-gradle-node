# Node Version Manager (NVM)

Because you use `sdkman` to manage g3 tools, right?

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh | bash`

[NVM Website](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

note:
- DONT download node from their Website
- DONT brew install node (you'll have a terrible time switching between versions later on)
- Can tell bad stories of people sudo global installing node packages and getting all screwed up with file permissions...
