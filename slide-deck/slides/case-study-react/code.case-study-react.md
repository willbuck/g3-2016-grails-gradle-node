##  Project Overview

![Profile structure](img/react-code-overview.png)
note:
  We're going to look at a different approach to using a Node-based "framework" (library) with Grails. The React profile actually comes in two flavors, one of which is really identical to the project that Will just demo'd, using React for the client instead of Angular.

  The other option is to use webpack/npm from within the Grails app itself - this can be tricky to configure, which is where the profile comes in.
