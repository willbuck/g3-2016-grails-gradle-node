note:
- If you're going to work with node more extensively (not wanting to add tasks all the time)
- DONT download node from their Website
- DONT brew install node (you'll have a terrible time switching between versions later on)
- Can tell bad stories of people sudo global installing node packages and getting all screwed up with file permissions...
