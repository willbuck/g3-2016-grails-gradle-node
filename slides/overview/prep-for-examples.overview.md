##  For the Examples

If you later want to following along with the examples, we recommend installing

[sdk man](http://sdkman.io/install.html) 

`$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`

and after that, in a new terminal window, 

[Grails 3.2.3](http://docs.grails.org/latest/) 

`$ sdk use grails 3.2.3`

note:
    - Good thing to occupy yourselves with, as next we will be introducing ourselves
