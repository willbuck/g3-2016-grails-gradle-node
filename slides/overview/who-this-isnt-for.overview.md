##  Who this approach is not for

- Small teams happy with their current full-stack tooling
- Teams highly invested in the asset-pipeline plugin ecosystem (which is great at what it does, make no mistake)

note:
- If your team prefers to manage all aspects with groovy, node may not appeal
- Asset Pipeline offers a way to do many of the same things the node exosystem can with groovy
